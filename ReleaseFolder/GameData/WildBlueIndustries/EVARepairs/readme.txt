EVA Repairs

The stock KSP game now has EVA Repair Kits that are used to fix things like solar panels, wheels, and landing legs. But why not use them to fix engines, drills, and ISRU converters? With EVA Repairs, now you can!

This mini-mod introduces part wear and tear, but only to a select few parts like the aforementioned engines, drills, and ISRU converters. These parts all have a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rating, and when that rating reaches zero, the part is disabled until a kerbal or a repair bot goes outside and fixes it with one or more EVA Repair Kits. Once fixed, the part is re-enabled.

Changes

- Removed KRASH support since the wrapper was causing NREs.
- Added EVA Repairs app button. This button toggles EVA Repairs on and off. Look for the gear and wrench icon in the KSP App toolbar. It is available in the VAB/SPH and in flight.
- Fixed issue where some difficulty options were appearing even when EVA Repairs was disabled.
