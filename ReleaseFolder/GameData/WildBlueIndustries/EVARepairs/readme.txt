EVA Repairs

The stock KSP game now has EVA Repair Kits that are used to fix things like solar panels, wheels, and landing legs. But why not use them to fix engines, drills, and ISRU converters? With EVA Repairs, now you can!

This mini-mod introduces part wear and tear, but only to a select few parts like the aforementioned engines, drills, and ISRU converters. These parts all have a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rating, and when that rating reaches zero, the part is disabled until a kerbal or a repair bot goes outside and fixes it with one or more EVA Repair Kits. Once fixed, the part is re-enabled.

Simply copy all the files into your GameData folder. When done, it should look like:

New Part

- T-800 Recharging Station: This small storage cabinet can dock a T-800 Repair Bot inside. It also doubles a small radially attached service bay.

Changes

- Removed ability for probe cores to fail. Game testing shows that they fail too early for interplanetary missions, especially since players are likely to forget to hibernate the probe.
- Deployable landing gears and legs will only lose MTBF if they are retracting or extending.
