EVA Repairs

The stock KSP game now has EVA Repair Kits that are used to fix things like solar panels, wheels, and landing legs. But why not use them to fix engines, drills, and ISRU converters? With EVA Repairs, now you can!

This mini-mod introduces part wear and tear, but only to a select few parts like the aforementioned engines, drills, and ISRU converters. These parts all have a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rating, and when that rating reaches zero, the part is disabled until a kerbal or a repair bot goes outside and fixes it with one or more EVA Repair Kits. Once fixed, the part is re-enabled.

Simply copy all the files into your GameData folder. When done, it should look like:

New Parts

- T-800 T.H.O.M.P.B.E.R.R.Y. Repair Bot: This advanced robot is capable of making repairs on broken parts in place of an engineer. It can also repair tires, solar arrays, and deployable antennas, and it can even repack parachutes. It has a small storage compartment for holding EVA Repair Kits.
- T-800 Micro Wheel: This wheel is specially scaled for the T-800 Repair Bot for those times when you need to drive around and make repairs.
- T-800 Micro Docking Port: This is an exceptionally small docking port that has been scaled for the T-800 Repair Bot.

Changes

- Deployable landing gear and deployable landing legs can now break. You'll need to enable the "Deployable landing gear and legs can break" difficulty option.
- If KRASH is installed, then EVA Repairs will be disabled while a KRASH simulation is running.
- The max science that a part can gain when the part's activation check fails will now vary between 1 and 10 science points.
- The science gained when the part fails will also vary, up to the maximum possible science that can be gained for that part.
- The science gained when the part fails will now respect the science gain mulitplier game difficulty setting.
- Fixed issue where EVA Repairs wasn't being added to probe cores that had no reaction wheels.
